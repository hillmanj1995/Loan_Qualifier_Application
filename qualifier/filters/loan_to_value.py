# @TODO Define a function that implements the following user story:
# As a lender,
# I want to filter the bank list by checking if the customer's loan-to-value is equal to or less than the maximum loan-to-value ratio allowed by the bank
# so that we assess if the customer's home value is worth as an asset to secure the loan

    loan_to_value_approval_list = []

    for bank in bank_list:

            loan_to_value_approval_list.append(bank)
    return loan_to_value_approval_list
